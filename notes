1..REACT::
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
React is used to build single-page applications.
React allows us to create reusable UI components.
2..Some times me need to install  npm modules for that use commends ::
 npm install -g npm
3..INSTILATION OF REACT ::
 rect is created using commends  are::
  a).npx create-react-app appname 
    it will create the react app in javascript 
  b).npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript
    it will create the react app in typescript 
4..after executing this commends it will show some instructions follow that 
  instructions (cd filename(change the location of the) and npm start(for running the app) )
5.. now you are react app is created with some packages and other things u can find some folders and files in the react folder(created folder)
6.. now in src folder create a folder (components)
7.. now in components folder yu can write the codes in jsx(javascript) and tsx(typescript) extensions (filename.jsx/tsx) (depend on created react app)
   example of tsx( ......
    function Hello() {
    const name = "Keerthan";
    return (
        <> (use depend up)
        <h2>You are all welcome to TypeScript</h2>
        <h4>Welcome...{name}</h4>
      </>
       );
          }
   export default Hello;
.... )
 example of jsx(..............
    import React from 'react';
    function Hello() {
    const name = "Keerthan";
    return (
    <>
      <h2>You are all welcome to TypeScript</h2>
      <h4>Welcome...{name}</h4>
    </>
  ); 
          }

export default Hello;

In this JSX code, we import React at the beginning to use JSX syntax. The rest of the component remains the same,
.........)  


8..after that come to App.js/App.tsx  file (open it )
9..you will see come code in writen inside the react(.....code....) modife it for u r code 
10..now u have to import the code writen in tsx/jsx file 
11.. write<function(Message)></function(Message)> in tsx/jsx file 
12...import the file in react by writing starting of the code (import Hello from './components/message';) or u can directly import this in vs code by fixind(it show the error and u can fix it it will auto import the floder)
13...start running the react app(npm start //commend) 

by this steps u can create and run the react app
